My machine can handle running up to 6 agents in parallel, but my test infrastructure only supports one agent running tests at a time. What I'd like is to create a workflow that kept six agents running constantly. Some of them would be doing actual coding work, some would be reviewers. The reviewers would be responsible for assessing completed but unmerged tasks for task completion and code correctness, merging main into the worktree's feature branch, resolving any conflicts, and then running the full test suite before merging. There needs to be zero tolerance for failing tests. Again only one agent can run tests at a time. How could I support this workflow so that claude orchestrates it for me? (I'm asking strategically, I don't want you to launch the workflow yet.)"
