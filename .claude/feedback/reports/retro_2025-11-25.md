### Negative (0 entries)

(none)

### Corrective (0 genuine, 1 filtered)

**Filtered:**
- **"oh that's interesting. i'm actually already recording all your actions..."** (2025-11-25T23:40:59Z)
  - Reason: Not correcting behavior, but sharing information about existing functionality
  - Classification: False positive - "actually" keyword triggered but was informational, not corrective

| Timestamp | Original Text | Trigger | Reason Filtered |
|-----------|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| 2025-11-25T23:49:41Z | "ok nice work, thank you for the thorough report..." | positive | Different session (f5f9699f) - unrelated context |
| 2025-11-26T00:15:00Z | "One more thing: is there any point to including..." | positive | Question about design, not praise |
| 2025-11-26T00:27:35Z | "nice work, that was so much faster than before..." | positive | Different session (f5f9699f) - unrelated context |
| 2025-11-26T00:28:26Z | "clean up the stale worktrees, then we'll end..." | positive | Different session (f5f9699f) - unrelated context |

Summary of activity during feedback period:
- Designed behavioral reinforcement system (FEAT-050)
- Implemented observe.sh hook modifications for feedback capture
- Added tool use logging for Edit, Write, Bash, Read, Grep, Glob
- Expanded sentiment keyword lists (70+ positive, 65+ negative, 45+ corrective)
- Created /retro slash command
- Created /wrapup slash command
- Updated CLAUDE.md with new system documentation

Primary activities: Feature design, implementation, and documentation

## Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Collaborative Design Before Implementation
**Signals:** 4 entries
**Evidence:**
- "This was such a good session. Thanks so much." (after design discussion)
- "amazing. you're really doing great with this project." (after iterative refinement)
- "ok excellent. let's do it." (after presenting options)
- "ok awesome..." (after explaining hook options)
**Observation:** User consistently praised sessions where design was discussed thoroughly before implementation began. The collaborative Q&A approach where user shaped architecture decisions earned strong positive feedback.

### Pattern 2: Demonstrating Working Results
**Signals:** 2 entries
**Evidence:**
- "that's really awesome. again, great work." (after seeing live tool logging)
- "YES!!!!" (after seeing retrospective analysis work)
**Observation:** Enthusiasm spikes when the user can see systems working in real-time, not just when told they're complete. Demonstrating concrete output is more satisfying than verbal confirmation.

### Pattern 3: Explaining Reasoning
**Signals:** 2 entries
**Evidence:**
- "just keep one big log. I think you're right..." (after trade-off explanation)
- "fascinating" (after explaining log size considerations)
**Observation:** User engages more positively when recommendations come with clear rationale, trade-offs, and reasoning rather than just bare recommendations.

## Candidate Principles

### LP-001: Discuss Design Before Implementing
**Source:** Retro 2025-11-25 (4 positive signals)
**Pattern:** User praised collaborative design discussions before coding
**Rule:** When building new features or systems, engage in thorough design discussion with the user before writing any code. Present architecture options, ask clarifying questions, and confirm the approach before implementation.
**Rationale:** Multiple instances of praise came after collaborative design discussions where the user shaped the approach through iterative Q&A before any code was written.

### LP-002: Demonstrate Working Results, Not Just Completion
**Source:** Retro 2025-11-25 (2 positive signals)
**Pattern:** User showed enthusiasm when seeing systems work in real-time
**Rule:** When implementing features, show concrete evidence of functionality rather than just reporting completion. Demonstrate live output, show captured data, or run examples that prove the system works.
**Rationale:** Strong positive reactions occurred when the system demonstrated itself working - like seeing the first feedback entry captured during development.

### LP-003: Explain Reasoning Behind Recommendations
**Source:** Retro 2025-11-25 (2 positive signals)
**Pattern:** User appreciated when recommendations came with clear rationale
**Rule:** When presenting options or making recommendations, explain the reasoning behind each choice. Include trade-offs, implications, and why one approach might be preferred over another.
**Rationale:** User responded positively when given thorough explanations of design considerations and trade-offs rather than just bare recommendations.

## Conflicts Detected

(none)

All candidate principles are compatible with existing CLAUDE.md guidance and enhance rather than contradict established practices.

## Recommendations for Next Retro

1. **Monitor for negative feedback:** This retro had 0 negative signals - the system hasn't been tested with criticism yet. Watch for how well negative patterns are identified.

2. **Watch for principle conflicts:** As more principles accumulate, potential tensions may emerge. Future retros should carefully check new principles against existing ones.

3. **Consider principle specificity:** These first principles are somewhat broad. As data accumulates, look for opportunities to make principles more specific and actionable.

4. **Track principle effectiveness:** Note whether following these principles correlates with continued positive feedback in future sessions.
