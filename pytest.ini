# Pytest configuration for CI/CD compatibility

markers =
    slow: marks tests as slow (deselected with '-m "not slow"')
    skip_ci: marks tests to skip in CI environments (timing/env-sensitive)
    integration: marks tests as integration tests (use '-m integration' to run only these)
    benchmark: marks tests as benchmarks for performance measurement
    serial: marks tests that must run serially (not safe for parallel execution)

# Skip CI-sensitive tests when running in GitHub Actions
addopts =
    --strict-markers
    -v

# Parallel test execution (Phase 3 optimization)
# Uncomment to enable by default, or use: pytest -n auto
# Note: Tests marked with @pytest.mark.serial will still run serially
# addopts = -n auto
