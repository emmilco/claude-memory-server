### Fixed
- **BUG-291: Connection Pool Race Condition - Max Size Enforcement**
  - Fixed race condition where multiple coroutines could bypass max_size limit under high concurrency (100+ requests)
  - Moved atomic _created_count increment inside lock BEFORE connection creation to ensure check-and-increment atomicity
  - Applied fix to all code paths: empty pool acquisition, connection recycling, and health-check retry
  - Added error handling to prevent slot leaks when connection creation fails after counter increment
  - Files: src/store/connection_pool.py
