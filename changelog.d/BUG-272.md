### Fixed
- **BUG-272: Simplify ProcessPoolExecutor Cleanup (3rd attempt)**
  - Removed all automatic cleanup handlers (atexit, signal handlers, weak set)
  - Previous approaches caused test framework interference and race conditions
  - Kept only explicit close() method (preferred) and __del__() fallback (wait=False)
  - Enhanced documentation emphasizing explicit cleanup requirement
  - Simpler implementation: fewer moving parts, less complexity, more reliable
  - Files: src/embeddings/parallel_generator.py
