### Fixed
- **BUG-272: ProcessPoolExecutor Not Cleaned Up in Parallel Generator __del__**
  - Added atexit handler to ensure proper executor cleanup on normal program termination
  - Added signal handlers (SIGTERM/SIGINT) for cleanup on process signals
  - Added comprehensive documentation about explicit close() requirement in class docstring
  - Enhanced close() method docstring to emphasize importance of explicit calls
  - Updated __del__() docstring to document the 4-tier cleanup strategy
  - Cleanup now uses wait=True in fallback handlers to ensure workers fully terminate
