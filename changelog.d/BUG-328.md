### Fixed
- **BUG-328: Git Detection Has No Error Recovery for Subprocess Timeouts**
  - Added specific `subprocess.TimeoutExpired` exception handlers to prevent silent failures
  - Changed timeout logging from DEBUG to WARNING level for better visibility of system issues
  - Reduced subprocess timeout from 5 seconds to 2 seconds for faster failure detection
  - Prevents 8+ minute blocking delays when processing many files with git subprocess timeouts
  - Files: src/memory/git_detector.py
