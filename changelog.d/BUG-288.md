### Fixed
- **BUG-288: Fix task tracking dictionary race condition**
  - Fixed race condition in background_indexer.py where _active_tasks dict could be modified concurrently
  - Replaced unsafe `del self._active_tasks[job_id]` with `self._active_tasks.pop(job_id, None)` in two locations
  - In cancel_job() (line 256): Prevents KeyError if task already removed by finally block
  - In _run_job() finally block (line 491): Prevents KeyError if task already removed by cancel_job()
  - Files: src/memory/background_indexer.py
