### Fixed
- **BUG-446: Orphaned Tag Associations After Memory Deletion** (duplicate of BUG-092)
  - Verified that fix is already implemented in codebase
  - TagManager.cleanup_memory_tags() method exists and removes all tag associations for deleted memories
  - MemoryService.delete_memory() calls cleanup_memory_tags() after successful deletion from Qdrant
  - Tag cleanup failures are logged as warnings without blocking delete operation
  - Files: src/services/memory_service.py (lines 598-607), src/tagging/tag_manager.py (lines 471-492)
  - Original fix was implemented in commit a5a39fc (BUG-092)
