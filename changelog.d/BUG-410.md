### Fixed
- **BUG-410: Call Graph Store Never Closed - Resource Leak**
  - Added `close()` method to `QdrantCallGraphStore` to properly close Qdrant client connection
  - Updated `IncrementalIndexer.close()` to call `call_graph_store.close()` for proper cleanup
  - Prevents resource leak from unclosed QdrantClient connections in call graph store
  - Files: src/store/call_graph_store.py, src/memory/incremental_indexer.py
