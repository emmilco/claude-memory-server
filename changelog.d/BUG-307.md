### Fixed
- **BUG-307: Race Condition in Service Stats Updates**
  - Fixed race condition in `get_stats()` methods where `self.stats.copy()` was called without acquiring `self._stats_lock`
  - Between the dict copy operation and completion, stats could be modified by another thread causing inconsistent reads
  - Wrapped `self.stats.copy()` with `with self._stats_lock:` in all 6 affected services
  - Files: src/services/memory_service.py, src/services/code_indexing_service.py, src/services/cross_project_service.py, src/services/health_service.py, src/services/query_service.py, src/services/analytics_service.py
