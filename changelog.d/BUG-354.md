### Fixed
- **BUG-354: Race Condition in NotificationManager._last_progress_time Dict Access**
  - Added `asyncio.Lock()` to protect throttle check read-check-write pattern
  - Prevents multiple concurrent `notify_progress` calls from bypassing throttle
  - Files: src/memory/notification_manager.py
