### Fixed
- **BUG-336: SQL Injection Vulnerability in Alert Engine Query**
  - Replaced f-string interpolation with parameterized query in `get_active_alerts()` method
  - Changed from `query += f" AND (snoozed_until IS NULL OR snoozed_until < '{now}')"` to parameterized query with `?` placeholder
  - Prevents potential SQL injection while maintaining identical functionality
  - Files: src/monitoring/alert_engine.py:412-415
