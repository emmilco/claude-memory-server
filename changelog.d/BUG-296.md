### Fixed
- **BUG-296: File Watcher Debounce Task Race Condition**
  - Fixed race condition in `_debounce_callback()` where task cancellation and creation happened outside lock
  - Moved entire debounce task management (cancel + await + create) inside `pending_lock` critical section
  - Prevents concurrent debounce tasks when multiple file events arrive simultaneously
  - Files: src/memory/file_watcher.py
