### Fixed
- **BUG-415: Add validation for usage_analytics_retention_days**
  - Added field validator to enforce reasonable bounds (1-730 days)
  - Prevents unbounded storage growth from excessively long retention periods
  - Consistent with other timeout validators in the codebase
  - Files: src/config.py
