### Fixed
- **BUG-403: UsageTracker Stats Counters Have Partial Lock Coverage**
  - Added `self._counter_lock` protection to stats updates at lines 207-211 in `_flush()` method
  - Added `self._counter_lock` protection to stats reads in `get_tracker_stats()` method
  - Fixed race condition: removed unsafe `_pending_updates` access in `get_tracker_stats()` (line 336)
  - Ensures consistent threading.Lock usage for all `self.stats` dictionary access
  - Separates threading.Lock (for atomic counter operations per REF-030) from asyncio.Lock (for data structure access)
  - Files: src/memory/usage_tracker.py
