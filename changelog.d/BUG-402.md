### Fixed
- **BUG-402: Trend Analysis Direction Logic Has Edge Case Bug**
  - Replaced confusing compound ternary operators with explicit if/elif logic for trend direction determination
  - Added named constants `TREND_SIGNIFICANT_CHANGE` (5.0%) and `TREND_HIGHLY_SIGNIFICANT` (10.0%) for clearer threshold management
  - Improved code readability by breaking down complex conditional logic into separate, well-commented branches
  - Fixed threshold behavior to be more transparent and maintainable
