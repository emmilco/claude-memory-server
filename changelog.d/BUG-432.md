### Fixed
- **BUG-432: Clarified filter_by_depth Documentation**
  - Enhanced docstring for `DependencyGraph.filter_by_depth()` to explicitly document that nodes at exactly max_depth ARE included in results, but their children are not explored
  - Added concrete examples showing expected behavior for max_depth values 0, 1, and 2
  - Added inline comment explaining the `depth < max_depth` condition logic
  - Files: src/graph/dependency_graph.py
  - Note: No code changes needed - current implementation is correct and all tests pass
