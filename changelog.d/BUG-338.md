### Fixed
- **BUG-338: Add exc_info to connection pool error logs**
  - Added `exc_info=True` to all logger.error() calls in connection_pool.py to capture full stack traces in production
  - Fixed 6 error log calls: pool initialization, health check failures, connection acquisition, release, and creation errors
  - Files: src/store/connection_pool.py (lines 262, 411, 446, 499, 673, 681)
