### Fixed
- **BUG-060: Cache Statistics Reset Without Holding Counter Lock**
  - Verified that `_clear_sync()` method in `src/embeddings/cache.py` properly acquires `_counter_lock` before resetting `hits` and `misses` counters
  - Fix prevents race condition when cache operations run concurrently with clear()
  - Implementation uses `with self._counter_lock:` context manager (lines 501-503)
  - Part of REF-030 atomic counter operations improvement
  - Files: src/embeddings/cache.py
