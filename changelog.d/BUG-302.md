### Fixed
- **BUG-302: Add debug logging for large pagination offsets**
  - Added debug logging when pagination offset > 0 to warn about potentially excessive offsets that may exceed available data
  - Prevents silent failures when offset is extremely large (e.g., 1000000000)
  - Applied to both `get_indexed_files()` and `list_indexed_units()` methods
  - Files: src/store/qdrant_store.py
