### Fixed
- **BUG-276: P95 Index Out of Bounds on Empty/Single-Element List**
  - Fixed P95 calculation that incorrectly evaluated index before ternary check, causing IndexError
  - Removed redundant empty-list guard (already handled by early return on line 679)
  - Added clarifying comment that early return guarantees non-empty list
