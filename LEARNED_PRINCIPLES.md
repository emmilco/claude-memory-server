## How This Works

1. **Feedback Capture:** As you interact with Claude, sentiment keywords in your messages trigger automatic logging to `.claude/feedback/feedback_log.jsonl`

2. **Retrospective Analysis:** Running `/retro` analyzes accumulated feedback, filters false positives, identifies patterns, and generates candidate principles

3. **Principle Generation:** Patterns that recur (2+ instances) become candidate principles for your approval

4. **Application:** Approved principles are added to this file and referenced during future sessions
